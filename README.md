# AlexaSonosController

Note: This was made esentially useless by the sonos integration/skill that was added sometime after this was made. Use the native integration as it works much better than making your device think your speaker is a lamp...

Let's you use an amazon echo or echo dot to control a play:1 or any other sonos speaker for that matter!
It does this by emulating a wemo outlet and responsing to words like "start my ------" or "stop -------" where the ---- is your custom device name. You can use any words that you can use with a wemo outlet.
