# AlexaSonosController
Let's you use an anazon echo or echo dot to control a play:1 or any other sonos speaker for that matter!
It does this by emulating a wemo outlet and responsing to words like "start my ------" or "stop -------" where the ---- is your custom device name. You can use any words that you can use with a wemo outlet.
